The strength of the extension is as follows: Let CAP be the number of the uppercase letters in the extension's name, and let SM be the number of lowercase letters in the extension's name, the strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM.\nYou should find the strongest extension and return a string in this format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.\nIf there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should choose the one that comes first in the list.\nFor example, if you are given \"Slices\" as the class and a list of the extensions: ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'] then you should return 'Slices.SErviNGSliCes' since 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension (its strength is -1).\nExample:\nfor Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) =='my_class.AA'"}
