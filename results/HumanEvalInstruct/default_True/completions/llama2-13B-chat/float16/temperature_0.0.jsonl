For example, `floor(3.5)` returns `3`.\n2. `number - floor(number)`: This expression subtracts the floor of the number from the original number. This gives us the decimal part of the number.

First, we check if the length of the input list is less than 2. If it is, we return None, since there are no elements to compare.\n2. Next, we initialize the smallest and largest elements in the list to be the first and last elements, respectively.\n3. Then, we iterate over the middle elements of the list (i.e., all elements except the first and last). For each of these middle elements, we calculate the distance between it and both the smallest and largest elements.\n4. We keep track of the closest smaller element and the closest larger element, based on their distances from the current middle element. If the distance between the current middle element and the smallest element is less than or equal to the distance between the current middle element and the largest element, we update the closest smaller and larger elements accordingly.\n5. Finally, we return the closest smaller and larger elements as a tuple.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function behaves:\n\n* `find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])` returns `(2.0, 2.2)`, since the two closest elements are 2.0 and 2.2.\n* `find_closest_elements([1.0,", "completion": "\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        return None\n    smallest, largest = numbers[0], numbers[-1]\n    closest_smaller = None\n    closest_larger = None\n    for num in numbers[1:-1]:\n        distance_smaller = abs(num - smallest)\n        distance_larger = abs(num - largest)\n        if closest_smaller is None or distance_smaller < closest_smaller:\n            closest_smaller = distance_smaller\n            closest_larger = distance_larger\n        elif distance_larger < closest_larger:\n            closest_smaller = distance_smaller\n            closest_larger = distance_larger\n    return closest_smaller, closest_larger"}

First, we find the minimum and maximum values in the list of numbers.\n2. Then, we subtract the minimum value from each number to get the difference between each number and the minimum value.\n3. We divide each difference by the range of the data (i.e., the maximum value minus the minimum value). This gives us a list of fractions, where each fraction represents the number relative to the minimum value.\n4.

In this case, we're passing `l` as the list of items to compare, and `lambda x: x` as the `key` function.\n2. `lambda x: x`: This is the `key` function we're passing to `max()`.

This function is used to compare the elements in the list.\n3. `max(l, key=lambda x: x)`: This line calls the `max()` function with the list `l` and the `key` function `lambda x: x`. The `max()` function will iterate over the list and compare each element using the `key` function.

If you prefer, you can omit the `key` function and use the default comparison operator, like this:\n\ndef max_element(l: list):\nreturn max(l)\n\nThis function will work the same way as the previous one, but it may", "completion": "return max(l, key=lambda x: x)\n\n1. `max(l, key=lambda x: x)`: This is the main line of the function. `max()` takes two arguments: a list of items to compare, and a `key` function that specifies how to compare the items.

We define a key function `lambda x: (x.bit_count(), x)` to specify how to compare the elements.\n3. The `bit_count` method returns the number of ones in the binary representation of the integer.\n4. We use the `lambda` function to wrap the `bit_count` method and the integer element in a tuple, so that we can compare the elements based on the number of ones in their binary representation, and then by their decimal value if there are the same number of ones.\n5. The `sorted` function will then sort the list based on the tuples returned by the key function.\n\nHere are some examples to demonstrate the function's behavior:\n\n* `sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, as expected.\n* `sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6])` returns `-6, -5, -4, -3, -2`, as expected.\n* `sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4])` returns `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, as expected.\n\nNote that the `bit_count` method is not built-in to Python, but it can be easily implemented using the `bin()` method and a regular expression:\n```\ndef bit_count(n):\n    return len(re.findall(r'1', bin(n)))\n```\nThis function returns the number of ones in the binary representation of the integer.", "completion": "\n    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (x.bit_count(), x))\n"}
