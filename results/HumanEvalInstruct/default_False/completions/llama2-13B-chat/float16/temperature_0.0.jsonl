The function takes a string `paren_string` as input.\n2. We use a regular expression to match any sequence of one or more word characters (`\\w+`) that are enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses are matched using the `()` syntax.\n3. The `re.findall` function returns a list of all matches in the input string.\n4. Since we're only interested in the matched groups, we return the list of matches.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\n>>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')\n['()', '(())', '(()())']\n```\nThis function should work for any input string with nested parentheses.

We initialize the `balance` variable to 0.\n2. We loop through the `operations` list, and for each operation, we check if it's positive or negative.\n3. If the operation is positive, we add it to the `balance` variable.\n4. If the operation is negative, we subtract it from the `balance` variable.\n5. At the end of the loop, we check if the `balance` variable is less than 0. If it is, we return `True`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at some point.

First, we calculate the mean of the input list using the `sum` and `len` functions.\n2. Next, we create a list of absolute deviations by subtracting the mean from each element in the input list and taking the absolute value.\n3. Finally, we sum the absolute deviations and divide by the length of the input list to get the mean absolute deviation.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n```\nprint(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))  # Output: 1.0\n```\nI hope this helps!

We define a `current_level` variable to keep track of the current level of nesting. We start at level 0.\n2. We iterate over each character in the `paren_string`.\n3. If the character is a `(`, we increment `current_level`.\n4. If the character is a )`, we decrement `current_level`.\n5. If `current_level` is 0, we add the current level to the `levels` list.\n6.

The function takes two arguments: `strings` and `substring`. `strings` is a list of strings, and `substring` is the substring to search for.\n2. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of strings that contain the given substring. The list comprehension iterates over the `strings` list and checks if the `substring` is present in each string. If it is, the string is added to the new list.\n3. The function returns the new list of strings that contain the given substring.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use the function:\n```\nfilter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')  # Output: ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']\nfilter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'd')  # Output: ['bacd', 'cde']\nfilter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'x')  # Output: []\n```\nI hope this helps!

We define a list comprehension that iterates over the input list `numbers`.\n2. Inside the comprehension, we check if the current index `i` is equal to 0. If it is, we return the first element of the list (`numbers[0]`).\n3. If `i` is not equal to 0, we use a slice of the list (`numbers[i-1:i+1]`) to find the maximum element in the range of `i-1` to `i+1` (inclusive).\n4.

If the input string is empty, return an empty string.\n2. Loop through the characters of the input string, starting from the first character.\n3. For each character, check if the substring starting from that character and ending at the end of the string is a palindrome. If it is, and the substring starts with the same characters as the input string, then we have found the palindromic suffix.\n4.

The `string_xor` function takes two string arguments `a` and `b`, which are assumed to consist only of 1s and 0s.\n2. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the characters of both strings and perform the XOR operation on each pair of characters. The XOR operation is performed using the `xor_bits` function, which takes two integers as input and returns their XOR.\n3. The `xor_bits` function converts each character to an integer in base 2 (i.e., binary) using the `int` function, and then performs the XOR operation using the `^` operator.\n4. The result of the XOR operation is converted back to a string using the `str` function, and the resulting string is returned by the `string_xor` function.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\nprint(string_xor('010', '110'))  # prints '100'\n```\nI hope this helps!

The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.\n2. The while loop checks if `a` and `b` are both positive. If either of them is 0, the function returns immediately.\n3. Inside the loop, we check if `a` divides `b` (i.e., if `a` is a factor of `b`). If it does, we return `b` as the greatest common divisor (GCD).\n4. If `a` does not divide `b`, we subtract `b` from `a` (using the `/=` operator). This has the effect of reducing `a` by the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.\n5. We repeat steps 3 and 4 until `a` is 0.\n6.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/18", "model_output": " Sure!

If it is, then we have found an overlap, and we add the number of characters in `string` that are not part of `substring` to the count.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function works:\n```\n>>> how_many_times('', 'a')\n0\n>>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')\n3\n>>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')\n3\n```\nNote that the function returns an integer, so it will always return an integer value (even if the substring is not found). If you want to return a boolean value indicating whether the substring was found or not, you can modify the function like this:\n```\ndef how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> bool:\n    return substring in string or (len(string) - len(substring)) * (substring in string[1:])\n```\nThis function will return `True` if the substring is found, and `False` if it is not found.", "completion": "    return string.count(substring) + (len(string) - len(substring)) * (substring in string[1:])\n"}

First, we check that the input list has at least two elements using a `len` check. If the list has fewer than two elements, we raise a `ValueError`.\n2. Next, we find the smallest and largest elements in the list using `min` and `max`.\n3. We then iterate over the list and check the distance between each element and both the smallest and largest elements. If an element is closer to the smallest element than the largest element, we add it to a list of closest pairs with the smallest element as the first element and the larger element as the second element. If an element is closer to the largest element than the smallest element, we add it to the list of closest pairs with the larger element as the first element and the smaller element as the second element.\n4. Finally, we return the two closest elements in the list of closest pairs, in the order of smaller element first, using a `Tuple` return type.\n\nHere are some examples of the function in action:\n```\nprint(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)\nprint(find_", "completion": "\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"List must have at least two elements\")\n\n    smallest = min(numbers)\n    largest = max(numbers)\n\n    closest_pairs = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if abs(num - smallest) < abs(num - largest):\n            closest_pairs.append((num, largest))\n        elif abs(num - smallest) < abs(num - smallest):\n            closest_pairs.append((num, smallest))\n\n    return closest_pairs[0], closest_pairs[1]\n"}

First, we find the minimum and maximum values in the list of numbers using the `min()` and `max()` functions.\n2. Next, we subtract the minimum value from each number in the list to get the difference between each number and the minimum value.\n3. Then, we divide each of these differences by the range of the list (i.e., the maximum value minus the minimum value). This gives us a list of values between 0 and 1.\n4. Finally, we add the minimum value to each of these values to get the final scaled values.\n\nHere's an example of how the function works with the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]`:\n\n1. Minimum value: 1.0\n2. Maximum value: 5.0\n3. Differences: [1.0 - 1.0, 2.0 - 1.0, 3.0 - 1.0, 4.0 - 1.0, 5.0 - 1.0] = [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\n4.

If `n` is 0, the largest divisor is 0.\n2. Otherwise, we find the largest divisor by taking the maximum of 1 and `n // 2`.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is as follows:\n\n* If `n` is even, then the largest divisor is clearly `n // 2`.\n* If `n` is odd, then the largest divisor is either `n // 2` or `n // 3`, since 2 and 3 are the only two divisors of `n` that are smaller than `n`. However, since `n // 2` is always even, and `n // 3` is always odd, we can choose the larger of the two, which is `n // 2`.\n\nHere's an example of how the function works:\n```\n>>> largest_divisor(15)\n5\n```\nIn this case, the largest divisor of 15 that is smaller than 15 is 5.", "completion": "\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return max(1, n // 2)\n"}

If the input `n` is 1 or 0, we return a list of one element, since there are no factors.\n2. We start by iterating from 2 to `n ** 0.5` (inclusive) to find the prime factors of `n`.\n3.

We convert the input list to a set using the `set()` function. This removes all duplicates from the list, since sets cannot have duplicates.\n2.

The function takes two arguments: `strings` and `prefix`. `strings` is a list of strings, and `prefix` is a string that we want to use as a filter.\n2. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of strings that pass the filter. The list comprehension takes the form `[string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]`.\n3.

The function takes a list `l` as input.\n2. The `max` function is used to find the maximum element in the list. The `max` function takes an iterable (such as a list) and returns the largest item in the iterable.\n3. Since we're looking for the maximum element in the list, we pass the list `l` directly to the `max` function.\n4. The function returns the maximum element found in the list.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function can be used:\n```\n>>> max_element([1, 2, 3])\n3\n>>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n123\n```\nAs you can see, the function returns the maximum element in the list, which is `123` in the second example.", "completion": "\n    return max(l)\n"}

We initialize the `count` variable to 0.\n2. We loop from 1 to `n+1` (inclusive).\n3. Inside the loop, we check if `i` is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, we know that `i` is a multiple of 11 or 13.\n4. If `i` is a multiple of 11 or 13, we check if `i % 7` is equal to 7. If it is, we increment `count` by 1.\n5. After the loop finishes, we return `count`.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function works:\n\n* `fizz_buzz(50)` returns 0 because there are no multiples of 11 or 13 between 1 and 50 that have a 7 in the ones place.\n* `fizz_buzz(78)` returns 2 because there are two multiples of 11 or 13 between 1 and 78 that have a 7 in the ones place: 71 and 78.\n* `fizz_buzz(79)` returns 3 because there are three multiples of 11 or 13 between 1 and 79 that have a 7 in the ones place: 71, 73, and 79.\n\nI hope this helps!

If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n` directly, since the first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and all smaller numbers are either 0 or 1.\n2. If `n` is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2`, which computes the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.\n3. The function then returns the sum of the two recursive calls, which is the `n`th Fibonacci number.\n4. The function checks if the result is prime using a simple check (see below).

The function takes a list `l` as input.\n2. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list.\n3.

We use the `zip` function to pair up each element in the list with its successor (i.e., the next element in the list).\n2. We use the `all` function to check if each pair of elements satisfies the monotonicity condition: whether the current element is less than or equal to its successor.\n3.

The `x` variable is used to represent the power of the current term, which starts at 0 and increases by 1 for each term.\n\nFor example, when `xs` is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the derivative is calculated as follows:\n\n* The first term is `3`, so the derivative is `3 + 1 * x = 3 + x`\n* The second term is `1`, so the derivative is `3 + 1 * x + 2 * x^2 = 3 + x + 2 * x^2`\n* The third term is `2`, so the derivative is `3 + 1 * x + 2 * x^2 + 4 * x^3 = 3 + x + 2 * x^2 + 4 * x^3`\n* The fourth term is `4`, so the derivative is `3 + 1 * x + 2 * x^2 + 4 * x^3 + 5 * x^4 = 3 + x + 2 * x^2 + 4 * x^3 + 5 * x^4`\n\nTherefore, the derivative of `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` is `[1, 4, 12, 20]`.\n\nSimilarly, when `xs` is `[1, 2, 3]`, the derivative is calculated as follows:\n\n* The first term is `1`, so the derivative is `1 + 2 * x = 1 +", "completion": "    return [xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x**2 + ...]\n"}

First, we check if the shift is greater than the number of digits in the integer x. If it is, we know that we need to reverse the digits, so we calculate the correct shift by subtracting the number of digits from the shift.\n2. Next, we use slicing to extract the portion of the string that we need to shift. Specifically, we use `str(x)[shift:]` to get the portion of the string that starts at the shift position and goes to the end of the string.\n3. We then use the `+` operator to concatenate the portion of the string that we just extracted with the portion of the string that we didn't extract. This gives us the circular shifted string.\n4.

If the length of the list `q` is 1, we simply check if the single element is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. If it is, we return `True`.\n2.

We use the `any` function to check if there are any indices `i` such that `string[i] != string[i+1]`.\n2. The `range` function generates a sequence of integers from 0 to `len(string) - 2`.\n3.

The first part of the function, `(n // 10) * (n // 10)`, counts the number of n-digit positive integers that start with 1. To see why, consider that if `n` is an n-digit positive integer, then `n // 10` is the number of 10s in `n`. So, the product of `n // 10` and `n // 10` counts the number of 10^2 = 100 times that `n` appears in the range of n-digit positive integers that start with 1.\n2. The second part of the function, `(n % 10) * (n % 10)`, counts the number of n-digit positive integers that end with 1. To see why, consider that if `n` is an n-digit positive integer, then `n % 10` is the last digit of `n`.

We use the built-in bin() function to convert the integer N to a binary string.\n2. We use the count() method to count the number of 4s (i.e., the digits) in the binary string.\n\nFor example, for N = 1000, the binary representation is \"1000\", and the count of 4s is 1, so the output is \"1\".\n\nFor N = 150, the binary representation is \"11110\", and the count of 4s is 6, so the output is \"110\".\n\nFor N = 147, the binary representation is \"1100101\", and the count of 4s is 12, so the output is \"1100\".\n\nThe function solves the problem by returning the total sum of the digits in binary. The solution is a string of binary numbers.\n\nNote that the function uses the constraint 0 \u2264 N \u2264 10000 to ensure that the input is valid.", "completion": "    return bin(N).count(4)"}

If it's not, we add a new key-value pair with the letter as the key and 1 as the value.\n4. After the loop finishes, we return the `counts` dictionary.\n\nHere are some examples of the function in action:\n```\nprint(histogram('a b c'))  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}\nprint(histogram('a b b a'))  # Output: {'a': 2, 'b': 2}\nprint(histogram('b b b b a'))  # Output: {'b': 4}\nprint(histogram(''))  # Output: {}\n```\nI hope this helps!

First, we use a list comprehension to create a new list `new_s` that contains all the characters in `s` that are not in `c`. This is done by iterating over the characters in `s` and checking if each one is not in `c`. If a character is not in `c`, we include it in the new list.\n2.

First, we check if there are any whitespace characters in the input string `txt`. We do this using the `whitespace_exists` function, which is defined below.\n2. If there are whitespace characters in `txt`, we use the `split` method to split the string into a list of words. This will return a list of substrings separated by whitespace.\n3. If there are no whitespace characters in `txt`, we instead use the `count_letters` function to count the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. This will return a single integer value.\n\nHere's the `whitespace_exists` function:\n```\ndef whitespace_exists(txt):\n    return any(char.isspace() for char in txt)\n```\nThis function checks if any of the characters in `txt` are whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, line breaks, etc.). If any are, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.\n\nHere's some sample usage of the `split_words` function:\n```\nprint(split_words(\"Hello world!\"))  # Output: [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\nprint(split_words(\"Hello,world!\"))  # Output: [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]\nprint(split_words(\"abcdef\"))  # Output: 3\n```\nI hope this helps!

First, we check if the list has fewer than 2 elements. If it does, we return True, since any list with fewer than 2 elements is automatically sorted.\n2. Next, we iterate over the list starting from the second element (i = 1).\n3. For each iteration, we check if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element. If it is, we continue to the next iteration.\n4. If we find an element that is not less than or equal to the previous element, we return False, since we have found a non-sorted section of the list.\n5.

We first check if the two intervals do not overlap by checking if their start points are not equal and their end points are not equal. If they do not overlap, we immediately return \"NO\".\n2.

First, we check if `n` is even by moduloing it by 2. If the result is not 0, then `n` is not even, and we immediately return `False`.\n2. Next, we check if `n` is less than 4.

The first line uses the `re.sub` method to replace all spaces in the input text with underscores.\n2. The second line uses the `re.sub` method again, but this time to replace consecutive spaces with a hyphen (-). The `r` prefix before the pattern makes the pattern a raw string, so that the spaces are treated as literal characters rather than as wildcards. The `(\\s+?)` pattern matches one or more whitespace characters (spaces or tabs), and the `?' quantifier makes the match non-greedy, so that the function only replaces the first occurrence of consecutive spaces.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function works:\n\n* `fix_spaces(\"Example\")` returns \"Example\" (no changes)\n* `fix_spaces(\"Example 1\")` returns \"Example_1\" (spaces replaced with underscores)\n* `fix_spaces(\" Example 2\")` returns \"_Example_2\" (consecutive spaces replaced with -)\n* `fix_spaces(\" Example   3\")` returns \"_Example-3\" (consecutive spaces replaced with -, and multiple spaces replaced with a single -)\n\nI hope this helps!

We start by splitting the sentence into words using the `split()` method. This gives us a list of words.\n2. We initialize an empty list called `prime_words` to store the prime words.\n3. We iterate over the words in the list and check if their lengths are prime using the `isprime()` function. If the length of a word is prime, we add it to the `prime_words` list.\n4.

We initialize two variables: `strongest_extension` and `strongest_strength`. `strongest_extension` will be the strongest extension found, and `strongest_strength` will be the strength of that extension.\n2. We loop through the `extensions` list and for each extension, we calculate its strength using the formula you provided: `len(extension.upper()) - len(extension.lower())`.\n3. We compare the strength of each extension to the current `strongest_strength`. If an extension has a higher strength, we update `strongest_strength` and `strongest_extension` accordingly.\n4. Once we've looped through all the extensions, we return the class name followed by the strongest extension.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function works:\n\n* `Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC'])` returns `my_class.AA` because `AA` has a strength of 2 (2 uppercase letters), while `Be` and `CC` have strengths of 1 (1 uppercase letter).\n* `Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'])` returns `my_class.SErviNGSliCes` because `SErviNGSliCes` has a strength of -1 (all uppercase letters), while `Cheese` and `StuFfed` have strengths of 0 (all lowercase letters).\n\nI hope this helps!

If `b` is found in `a`, we return `True` immediately.\n\nStep 2: If `b` is not found in `a`, we check if any rotation of `b` is a substring of `a`.

First, we check if the input number is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000. If it's not within this range, we return \"invalid\".\n2. Next, we initialize an empty string `roman` that will store the roman numeral equivalent of the input number.\n3. We then use a while loop to iterate through the digits of the input number. For each digit, we calculate its remainder when divided by 10 (using the `%` operator), and then add it to the `roman` string.\n4.

The function takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n2.

We initialize `max_word` to `None` and `max_length` to 0.\n2. We loop through each word in the input list `words`.\n3. For each word, we calculate its length using `len()`.\n4. We compare the length of the current word to the current maximum length (`max_length`). If the current word is longer than the current maximum, we update `max_word` and `max_length` accordingly.\n5.
