The sum of the number of times the substring is found is returned as the result.\n\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `string` and `substring`.\n2. The generator expression `range(len(string) - len(substring) + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 0 to `len(string) - len(substring) + 1`.

First, we split the input string into a list of individual numbers using the `split()` method. This gives us a list of strings, where each string represents a single number.\n2. Next, we convert the list of strings to a list of integers using a list comprehension. This is done by iterating over the list of strings and converting each one to an integer using the `int()` function.\n3.

First, we sort the input list in ascending order using the `sorted` function. This takes O(n log n) time in the worst case.\n2. Then, we iterate over the list, starting from the second element, and compare the distance between each pair of adjacent elements. We use the `abs` function to get the absolute difference between the two elements, which gives us the distance between them.\n3. We keep track of the closest pair of elements and their distance using the `closest_pair` and `closest_distance` variables. We initialize `closest_distance` to `float('inf')`, which is a large positive number that will be replaced by the smallest distance we find.\n4. If we find a pair of elements with a smaller distance than the current `closest_distance`, we update `closest_pair` and `closest_distance` accordingly.\n5. Finally, we return `closest_pair` as a tuple of two floats, which represents the two elements that are closest to each other in the input list.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we iterate over the list only once.

First, we check if the list of coefficients has an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient is not zero. If either of these conditions is not met, we return `None` because there is no guarantee of a solution.\n2. Next, we shift the coefficients by one to make the first coefficient zero. This is done by taking the first element of the list and adding it to the end of the list, and then discarding the first element. This effectively shifts the coefficients by one.\n3. We then evaluate the shifted polynomial at `x=0` using the `poly` function. If the result is not zero, we return `None` because there is no zero point.\n4.

For each index `i`, it checks whether `i` is divisible by 3. If it is not, it simply copies the value of `l[i]` to `l'[i]`. If it is, it takes the slice of `l` starting from `i` and ending at `i+3` (inclusive), sorts it, and sets the value of `l'[i]` to the first element of the sorted slice.\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. `l: list` is the input list.\n2. `return [...]` starts a list comprehension.\n3. `l[i] if i % 3 != 0 else ...` is a conditional expression that checks whether `i` is divisible by 3.

The `sorted()` function takes a list as input and returns a sorted list. The `key` argument is a function that takes an element of the list (i.e., a character) and returns its ASCII value. The `lambda` function is used to create an anonymous function that takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value.\n3. `\" \".join(sorted_words)`: This joins the sorted words back into a single string, separated by spaces. The `join()` method takes a list of strings and a separator string as input, and returns a string that concatenates the elements of the list with the separator string in between. In this case, the separator string is a space.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\ns = \"Hello World!!!!\"\nprint(anti_shuffle(s)) # Output: \"Hello !!!Wdlor\"\n```\nNote that the function assumes that the input string contains only printable ASCII characters. If the input string contains non-printable characters or characters from other character sets, the function may not work correctly.", "completion": "    # Split the string into words\n    words = s.split()\n\n    # Sort each word by ASCII value\n    sorted_words = [sorted(word, key=lambda x: ord(x)) for word in words]\n\n    # Join the sorted words back into a single string\n    return \" \".join(sorted_words)\n\ns = \"Hello World!!!!\""}

First, we initialize an empty list called `coordinates` to store the coordinates of the values in the row.\n2. We iterate through each row in the list using a for loop.\n3. For each row, we check if the value x is in the row using the `in` operator. If it is, we get the index of the value x in the row using the `index` method.\n4. We add the coordinate (row index, column index) to the `coordinates` list.\n5. We sort the `coordinates` list using the `sorted` function and the `key` argument. The `key` argument is a lambda function that takes a tuple and returns a tuple of the row index and column index. This sorts the coordinates first by row and then by column.\n6. Finally, we return the sorted `coordinates` list.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function works:\n\n* `get_row([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]], 1)` returns `[(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]`\n* `get_row([], 1)` returns an empty list `[]`\n* `get_", "completion": "    # Initialize an empty list to store the coordinates\n    coordinates = []\n\n    # Iterate through each row in the list\n    for row in lst:\n        # Check if the row contains the value x\n        if x in row:\n            # Get the index of the value x in the row\n            index = row.index(x)\n\n            # Add the coordinate (row index, column index) to the list\n            coordinates.append((row.index(x), index))\n\n    # Sort the coordinates by row and then by column\n    coordinates = sorted(coordinates, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n\n    return coordinates"}

First, we check the sum of the first and last elements of the array. If it's odd, we want to sort the array in descending order, otherwise, we want to sort it in ascending order.\n2. If the sum is odd, we use the `sorted` function with the `key` argument set to `lambda x: -x`. This will sort the array in descending order.\n3. If the sum is even, we use the `sorted` function without any additional arguments, which will sort the array in ascending order.\n4. We return the sorted array.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input array only contains non-negative integers.

Otherwise, we return the index of the largest element that can be arranged.\n\nHere's an example of how the function works for the input array `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`:\n\n1. `n = len(arr) = 5`\n2. `i = 1`\n3. `arr[i] = 2`\n4. `arr[i-1] = 1`\n5. `2 >= 1` is false, so we continue to the next iteration.\n6. `i = 2`\n7. `arr[i] = 4`\n8. `arr[i-1] = 2`\n9. `4 >= 2` is true, so we continue to the next iteration.\n10. `i = 3`\n11. `arr[i] = 3`\n12. `arr[i-", "completion": "    n = len(arr)\n    if n <= 1:\n        return -1\n    max_index = -1\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if arr[i] >= arr[i-1]:\n            continue\n        max_index = i\n    return max_index"}

Next, we check if n is positive by using the > operator. If n <= 0, then it cannot be written as the sum of positive even numbers, so we return False.\n3. Finally, we check if n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers by using the // operator (integer division) to divide n by 4.

Here's a possible implementation of the `do_algebra` function in Python:\n```\ndef do_algebra(operator, operand):\n    # Check the length of the operator and operand lists\n    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length of operator list must be one less than length of operand list\")\n\n    # Initialize the result to the first operand\n    result = operand[0]\n\n    # Evaluate the expression from the operator list\n    for op in operator:\n        if op == '+':\n            result += operand.pop(0)\n        elif op == '-':\n            result -= operand.pop(0)\n        elif op == '*':\n            result *= operand.pop(0)\n        elif op == '//':\n            result //= operand.pop(0)\n        elif op == '**':\n            result **= operand.pop(0)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator:\", op)\n\n    return result\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. First, we check that the length of the operator list is one less than the length of the operand list. This ensures that we have enough operands to evaluate the expression.\n2. We initialize the result to the first operand. This will be the starting point for evaluating the expression.\n3. We iterate over the operator list, applying each operator to the result and the next operand in the operand list. We use a series of if-else statements to handle each operator.\n4. For addition and subtraction, we simply add or subtract the next operand from the result.\n5. For multiplication, we multiply the result by the next operand.\n6. For floor division, we divide the result by the next operand, but we use the `//` operator to get the integer part of the result (i.e., the floor).\n7. For exponentiation, we raise the result to the power of the next operand.\n8. If we encounter an invalid operator, we raise a ValueError.\n9. Finally, we return the result of the expression evaluation.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\noperator = ['", "completion": "    # Check the length of the operator and operand lists\n    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length of operator list must be one less than length of operand list\")\n\n    # Initialize the result to the first operand\n    result = operand[0]\n\n    # Evaluate the expression from the operator list\n    for op in operator:\n        if op == '+':\n            result += operand.pop(0)\n        elif op == '-':\n            result -= operand.pop(0)\n        elif op == '*':\n            result *= operand.pop(0)\n        elif op == '//':\n            result //= operand.pop(0)\n        elif op == '**':\n            result **= operand.pop(0)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid operator:\", op)\n\n    return result\n\noperator = ['"}

First, we check if the string contains any letters using the `any` function and a generator expression that checks each character for being alphabetical (`chr.isalpha()`). If the string contains no letters, we simply reverse it using slicing (`s[::-1]`).\n2. Otherwise, we iterate over the characters of the string using a for loop. For each character, we check if it's alphabetical using `chr.isalpha()`. If it is, we reverse its case: if it's lowercase, we uppercase it using `chr.upper()`, and if it's uppercase, we lowercase it using `chr.lower()`. If the character is not alphabetical (i.e., it's a space, punctuation, or other non-letter character), we just append it to the result string without modification.\n3. Finally, we join the result list of characters into a string using the `join` method, and return it.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function works:\n\n* `solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"`: The string contains only digits, so we reverse it.\n* `solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"`: The string contains two letters, which we reverse.\n* `solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"`: The string contains a mix of letters and non-letters. We reverse the case of the letters, and keep the non-letters unchanged.\n\nI hope this helps!
