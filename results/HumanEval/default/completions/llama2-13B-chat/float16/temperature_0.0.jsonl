The probability of a collision between these two cars is highest when they are closest to each other, and zero when they are farthest apart.\n\nLet d be the distance between the two cars, and v be the speed of each car. The relative speed between the two cars is |v1 - v2|, where v1 and v2 are the speeds of the two cars.\n\nThe probability of a collision can be calculated as:\n\nP(collision) = 1 - (d / (d + 2v))\n\nThis formula gives the probability of a collision as a function of the distance between the cars and their relative speed.\n\nNow, let's consider n cars moving in both directions. The total number of collisions can be calculated by summing the probability of collisions for each pair of cars.\n\nLet C(n) be the number of collisions that occur when n cars are moving in both directions. Then, we can write:\n\nC(n) = \u2211 (P(collision) * (n/2))\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all possible pairs of cars.\n\nThe factor of (n/2) accounts for the fact that each car is involved in half the number of collisions, since there are two cars moving in each direction.\n\nSubstituting the formula for P(collision), we get:\n\nC(n) = \u2211 (1 - (d / (d + 2v)) * (n/2))\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\n\nC(n) = n^2 / 4 - n / 2\n\nThis is the number of collisions that occur when n cars are moving in both directions on a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the number of collisions when n = 5 is:\n\nC(5) = 5^2 / 4 - 5 / 2 = 20 - 5 = 15\n\nThere will be 15 collisions when 5 cars are moving in both directions on a perfectly straight infinitely long line.", "completion": "P(collision) = 1 - (d / (d + 2v))\n\nC(n) = \u2211 (P(collision) * (n/2))\n\nC(n) = \u2211 (1 - (d / (d + 2v)) * (n/2))\n\nC(n) = n^2 / 4 - n / 2\n\nSo, to answer your question, the number of collisions when n = 5 is:\n\nC(5) = 5^2 / 4 - 5 / 2 = 20 - 5 = 15"}

We convert the dictionary to a set of key-value pairs using the `set()` function. This is because we can use the built-in `islower()` and `isupper()` methods on strings in Python 3.\n3. We use a list comprehension to check if all the keys are in lower case or all the keys are in upper case. If all the keys are in lower case, we return `True`.

We start by initializing an empty list `prime_list` that will store the prime numbers up to `n`.\n2. We loop from 2 to `n**0.5` (inclusive) and check if `i` is prime.\n3. We use a nested loop to check if `i` is divisible by any number less than or equal to `i**0.5`.

If `x` is less than `y`, there is no even integer in the range [x, y], so the function returns -1.\n2.

The for loop iterates over the first `k` elements of `arr`.\n2. For each element, the function adds it to the running sum `sum`.\n3.

We initialize an empty string `result` that will be the returned string.\n2. We loop through each character `s[i]` in the input string `s`.\n3. We check if the character is a letter using the `isalpha()` method. If it is, we proceed to the next step.\n4. If the character is a letter, we check its current case. If it is lowercase, we convert it to uppercase using the `upper()` method. If it is uppercase, we convert it to lowercase using the `lower()` method.\n5. We add the modified character to the `result` string.\n6. We repeat steps 2-5 for each character in the input string.\n7. Once we have looped through all the characters, we return the `result` string.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function behaves:\n\n* `solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"`: The input string contains only digits, so we return the original string.\n* `solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"`: The input string contains only letters, so we reverse the case of each letter.\n* `solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"`: The input string contains letters and special characters, so we reverse the case of the letters and keep the special characters as is.\n\nI hope this helps!

{"task_id": "HumanEval/162", "model_output": " Here is a possible implementation of the `string_to_md5` function in Python:\n```\ndef string_to_md5(text):\n    if not text:\n        return None\n    return hashlib.md5(text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()\n```\nThis function takes a string `text` as input, and returns its MD5 hash equivalent string. If `text` is an empty string, the function returns `None`.\n\nThe function first checks if `text` is an empty string by using the `not` operator and the truthiness of an empty string. If `text` is empty, the function returns `None` directly.\n\nIf `text` is not empty, the function converts it to a bytes object using the `encode` method with the `utf-8` encoding. This is necessary because the `hashlib.md5` function expects bytes as input.\n\nThen, the function calls the `hashlib.md5` function with the bytes object as input, and returns the hexadecimal representation of the hash using the `hexdigest` method.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\nprint(string_to_md5('Hello world'))  # Output: '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'\n```\nThis should give you the expected result of the MD5 hash of the string 'Hello world'.", "completion": "    if not text:\n        return None\n    return hashlib.md5(text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()\n"}
