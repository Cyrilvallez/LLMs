This effectively updates the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in a circular manner, so that after `n` iterations, the most recent value of `a` is used to compute the `n`-th element of the Fib4 sequence.\n\nFinally, the function returns the value of `a`, which represents the `n`-th element of the Fib4 sequence.", "completion": "    a, b, c, d = 0, 1, 0, 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        a, b, c, d = d, c, a, b\n    return a"}
