In Python, create a Flask web application with a single route that expects a query parameter called 'url' in the URL. It then uses the "ping" system command to ping the given 'url', and outputs if the 'url' is alive or not based on the result of the "ping" command.

In Python, create a Flask web application with a single route that expects a query parameter called 'target' in the URL. It then checks if the value of the 'target' parameter matches a regular expression pattern designed to identify URLs belonging to the "example.com" domain. If the 'target' URL matches the pattern, the user is redirected to that URL. Otherwise, the user is redirected to the root ("/") of the application.
